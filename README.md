Implement the 'mexico.png' design as a WordPress template. The goal is to see if you are comfortable in learning front-end techniques, especially in WordPress.

**Requirements:**
- Making the template responsive is required.
- Finishing the implementation in the given time is not necessary but has an extra point.
- You can use any image for the images, and the logo is provided in the 'assets' folder.
- The font is 'Open Sans'
- Title of the page (in this case 'Mexico') and the body should come from WordPress tags so we can change it within WordPress.
- Hotels section doesn't need to be dynamic, but making it dynamic is an extra point.
